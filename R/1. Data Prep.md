# Organizing Data for Phyloseq: A Step-by-Step Guide

This script helps you organize your **biological datasets** (e.g., microbial counts, metadata, taxonomy) into a format suitable for the **`phyloseq`** R package. Phyloseq allows you to analyze and visualize microbiome data. This version includes **comments and visual examples** to make the process clear for beginners.

---

## **Step 1: Set Up the Environment**

Install and load the necessary libraries.

```r
# Load the required libraries
library(dplyr)      # Data manipulation
library(phyloseq)   # Microbiome analysis
library(vegan)      # Rarefaction analysis
```

Make sure the **working directory** is set correctly. This is the folder where your data files are stored.

```r
setwd("~/path/to/Qiime2ExportFiles")
```

---

## **Step 2: Load and Inspect Your Files**

### Files used:
- **Counts data**: Sample-by-feature matrix (e.g., ASV counts per sample).
- **Metadata**: Information about each sample (e.g., treatment, genotype).
- **Taxonomy**: Describes which taxa (microbial species) are present.

```r
counts <- read.csv("table/feature-table.t.csv") # From Qiime2 Step 8 Export
metadata <- read.csv("Merged-metadata.csv") # Project's relevant metadta (treatment, host, outcome,location, etc)
taxonomy <- read.csv("taxonomy/taxonomy.csv") # From Qiime2 Step 8 Export

# Display the first few rows of the taxonomy file
head(taxonomy)
```

**Example of a counts File:**
> Samples are rows, bacteria count data are columns.

| SampleID| ASV1 | ASV2 |
|---------|------|------|
| Sample1 | 5    |   0  |
| Sample2 | 10   |   20 |

**Example of a Metadata File:**
> Samples are rows, metadata are columns.

| SampleID| Treament  |  Outcome  |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Sample1 | Control   |   Control |
| Sample2 | Disease   |   Healthy |


**Example of a Taxonomy File:**
> Bacteria ASV full taxonomy names are Rows.

| Taxon            | Confidence | ASV  |
|------------------|------------|------|
| d__Bacteria; p__Proteobacteria | 1.00 | ASV1 |
| d__Bacteria; p__Actinobacteria | 0.97 | ASV2 |

---

## **Step 3: Clean and Simplify Taxonomy**

We simplify taxonomic names to remove prefixes (like "d__" for domain) and focus only on relevant parts (like species or genus).

```r
taxonomy <- taxonomy %>%
  mutate(SimplifiedTaxon = case_when(
    Confidence >= 0.97 ~ sub(".*s__([^;]+).*", "s__\\1", Taxon),
    TRUE ~ sub(".*g__([^;]+).*", "g__\\1", Taxon)
  )) %>%
  mutate(SimplifiedTaxon = gsub("^[a-z]__", "", SimplifiedTaxon)) # Remove prefixes

head(taxonomy)  # Preview the simplified taxonomy
```

---

## **Step 4: Organize Metadata - OPTIONAL**

We need to ensure that **metadata is consistent** across datasets. If some genotypes are missing, the decision is whether to keep or remove them.

Theses additional metadata files "symbiont_data" and "genotype_data" are metadata files from collaborators that we want to integrate into our microbial analysis. We need to find something, such as sample name that matches between datasets to merge the datasets and consider samples that may not consistently have been recorded in the collaborators research and think about if we want to include or remove those samples. Likely include for until you must remove at the specific analysis that doesnt want missing data. 

```r
# Load symbiont and genotype data
symbiont_data <- read.csv("AprilGenotypeSymbiont.csv")
genotype_data <- read.csv("GenotypeSusceptibility.csv")

# Merge symbiont and genotype data by 'DEP.Genotype'
combined_metadata <- merge(symbiont_data, genotype_data, by = "DEP.Genotype", all = TRUE)

# Preview the combined metadata
head(combined_metadata)
```

---

## **Step 5: Match and Merge Counts with Metadata**

We need to ensure that **every sample in the counts file** matches a sample in the metadata.

```r
# Check for unmatched samples
unmatched_counts <- setdiff(counts$SampleID, metadata$SampleID)
print(unmatched_counts)

# Merge counts with metadata
counts_metadata <- merge(metadata, counts, by = "SampleID", all = TRUE)
```

---

## **Step 6: Filter Low-Quality Samples**

Samples with **fewer than 5141 reads** (as determined by earlier filtering during qiime2) will be filtered out to ensure data quality.

```r
# Calculate total reads per sample
row_sums <- rowSums(counts_metadata[, 30:ncol(counts_metadata)])

# Filter out samples with low read counts
filtered_data <- counts_metadata[row_sums > 5141, ]

# Visualize read depth distribution
hist(row_sums, breaks = 20, main = "Read Depth Distribution", xlab = "Reads per Sample")
```

---

## **Step 7: Handle Duplicates**

Sometimes samples may appear more than once due to **genotype updates**. We’ll remove duplicates by keeping only the first occurrence. Make this decision based on your project.

```r
# Remove duplicates by 'SampleID'
counts_metadata_clean <- counts_metadata[!duplicated(counts_metadata$SampleID), ]

# Create a new identifier by combining genotype and sample IDs
counts_metadata_clean$DEPSampleID <- paste(counts_metadata_clean$DEP.Genotype, counts_metadata_clean$SampleID, sep = "_")

# Preview the cleaned dataset
head(counts_metadata_clean)
```

---

## **Step 8: Prepare Files for Phyloseq**

Before creating the phyloseq object, we need to ensure **dimensions align**. The **taxonomy table, metadata, and counts** must have matching rows and columns.

```r
# Check dimensions
dim(counts)  # Counts matrix
dim(metadata)  # Metadata
dim(taxonomy)  # Taxonomy

# Convert data to the required phyloseq format
otu_table <- otu_table(as.matrix(counts[, -1]), taxa_are_rows = TRUE)
sample_data <- sample_data(metadata)
tax_table <- tax_table(as.matrix(taxonomy))

# Create the phyloseq object
ps <- phyloseq(otu_table, tax_table, sample_data)
ps  # Print the phyloseq object
```

---

## **Step 9: Visualize the Phyloseq Object**

You can now use **phyloseq functions** to analyze and visualize your microbiome data. Here's an example rarefaction plot to assess species richness across samples.

```r
library(vegan)

# Calculate rarefaction
D.spec <- specnumber(counts_metadata[, 30:ncol(counts_metadata)])
D.specrare <- min(rowSums(counts_metadata[, 30:ncol(counts_metadata)]))
Srare <- rarefy(counts_metadata[, 30:ncol(counts_metadata)], D.specrare)

# Plot rarefaction curve
plot(D.spec, Srare, xlab = "Observed Species", ylab = "Rarefied Species")
abline(0, 1)
```

---

## **Conclusion**

This script walks you through the entire process of preparing your data for **phyloseq analysis**, from loading and cleaning files to visualizing the results. After completing these steps, you’ll be ready to analyze microbial diversity, community composition, and more using phyloseq’s powerful tools.

### **Visual Example of Phyloseq Alignment:**

| **Table**      | **Rows** | **Columns**      |
|----------------|----------|------------------|
| OTU Table      | 1000     | 300 Samples      |
| Taxonomy Table | 1000     | 8 Taxa Levels    |
| Metadata Table | 300      | 29 Metadata Items |

Make sure **these tables align** before running the final phyloseq step.
