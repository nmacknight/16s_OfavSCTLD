#Welcome

You are looking at a github repository that contains _educational instruction_ on how to perform the necessary **Benchwork**, **Bioinformatics**, and **Statistical Analysis** to investigate the taxonomic presence and abundance of a Microbiome.

My goal is to present this information so that a person who has never done it before can follow along and understand what they are doing with confidence. It is far from perfect. Through user feedback (You), I can make it better.

Please send me your comments to help improve the repository to nicholas.macknight@noaa.gov

If you have any questions about the functions of code or interpretation of results, I can try to help too. 

If you can bake a cake, you can perform molecular DNA/RNA extractions, but sometimes the grandparents have a few tricks that make it so much better.
